## Learning reflection
As a newcomer to mobile app design and development, I initially found some of the concepts to be quite challenging. Navigating through new terminology and technical aspects was a bit overwhelming at first, particularly when it came to understanding the structure of the project files and the app’s functionality. How-ever, the course materials, especially the step-by-step guides provided, were ex-tremely helpful in resolving these issues. By thoroughly reading through the guides and taking my time to follow the instructions, I was able to overcome these hurdles without much difficulty.
Interestingly, I didn’t find it necessary to consult friends or tutor students throughout this assignment. The clear explanations and documentation allowed me to work through the tasks independently. While I didn’t directly learn any-thing from my peers this time, I am aware that collaborating or asking for help could be a useful strategy in the future.
As the assignment progressed, I started to feel more confident in my ability to complete similar tasks in the future. The hands-on lab work was especially helpful in solidifying my understanding. I now feel that I have a base-level knowledge of mobile app design and development and am more prepared to tackle similar as-signments or projects going forward.
In summary, this assignment was a great learning experience. It introduced me to the basics of mobile app design, and I was able to successfully complete the hands-on lab work by utilizing the resources provided. I feel confident that I could handle future tasks in this area with even greater ease and efficiency.


## Step 1: Installing NodeJS 
I followed the Configure Mobile App Development Environment HANDS-ON LAB-WORK-1 step by step guide and downloaded and installed the NodeJS from given link (https://nodejs.org/en/). Installing NodeJS was easy and efortless. 
The additional tools installation was really slow, it took very long time. I was get-ting really confused, that did I do something wrong in the process? It took from 17:47 to 18:05 to progress and then I tried to press enter in the Windows Pow-ershell on line “Installing vcredist140-x86...” then the progress suddenly moved to “installed”. After that it started to install very slowly: “Installing vcredist140-x86...”. I notice I am getting a bit impatient. After that it proceeded fairly fast, but I did not get the same screen as in the guide at the end of installation in Win-dows Powershell. I was again a bit confused is everything now ok, or did some-thing go wrong. Then it seemed, that Powershell shutted itself down. After con-firming in command prompt that the environments were correctly installed I was relieved.

   
## Step 2: Installing the Git & Visual Studio Code
I had already installed the Git and Visual Studio Code in previous courses in Lau-rea.
I took a screenshot of the Git to verify that I have installed it (them) to my com-puter.


## Step 3: Installing Visual Studio Code
I have installed the Visual Studio Code in my first years of studies (January 2023), so I skipped this step. I have used it in couple of different courses before this course. I took a screenshot to show I have it installed on my computer.
 

## Step 4: Installing Java JDK
I was a little bit confused, about which version of JDK should I download. In the guide JDK17 was recommended, but in the download page there were Java 22, Ja-va 21, and Java 17 available. As they mentioned, that JDK 21 is the latest long-term support release of Java SE Platform, I thought it was the safest bet to be downloaded and used. The downlading and installation was relatively easy and straightforwarded.


## Step 5: Setting JDK Environment Variables
This was totally new for me, and I was worried that I make a mistake in the pro-cess. Thankfully, the instructions were quite clear and logical. They were easy to follow. One difficulty was, that my system language is in Finnish and the guide in English, also my system is Win11, so it was not exactly the same as in the guide. But it was still OK. I was sometimes unsure if I need to select something, e.g. af-ter adding the new JDK path, should I have selected or moved it, or was it enough that I just added the new one and closed all the windows by clicking OK.
 
 
## Step 6: Creating a simple Ionic Mobile App
Installing the Ionic CLI was easy. I was a bit worried (again) how will I execute the creating and starting an App.
I chose to start the App by guided prompted window. I was confused, as the writ-ten guide came after the screenshots, and I did not know what to do. Eventually, I found the written guide and steps. Using Ionic serve was easy, to view the mobile app in browser. I created an Ionic account with my GitHub credentials. There was a mistake in the guide “Now, type CTL+C to return to the command prompt again.” it should have been written “Use Ctrl+C to quit this process”. On that note, all together this was also an easy task to execute. I found myself wondering in the end, that in the step-by-step guide, creating the app by using Direct com-mand, it was advised to create all applications in “labwork-1” folder. There was no guide about this, in the Guided prompted windows section.
