# Mobile App Design and Development Course

Welcome to the repository of my Laurea University of Applied Siences, Mobile App Design and Development Course! This repository contains lab work and projects for six different modules, each focusing on a key aspect of mobile application design and development.

## Overview

Each module in this course includes hands-on lab work designed to help me build a strong foundation in mobile app development. By the end of the course, Iâ€™ll have a simple but fully functional mobile app that incorporates modern UI/UX design, interaction capabilities, data handling, and is ready for deployment.

## By the end of this Study Unit, I should be able to...
```bash
Differentiate the mobile app ecosystem and its pros and cons
Describe the key technologies to develop applications for the major mobile platforms
Configure and use a development environment for a chosen mobile platform
Design and develop a simple mobile application
```
